# How to Use this Package

For basic usage on how to load datasets, check out [Basics](./basics.md).

Sometimes, you want to be able to use `tabben` to work with a dataset that's not already in the benchmark, in which case check out [Custom Datasets](./custom.md).

If you're in an environment with particular restrictions, you may find [Special Situations](./special.md) useful.
