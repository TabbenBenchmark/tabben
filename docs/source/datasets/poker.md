# Poker Hand Dataset

The poker hand dataset is a deterministic dataset predicting the type of poker hand from the suits and ranks of the five cards in the hand.

You can read more of the description of the dataset from its [UCI ML Repo page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS).

## Data Preprocessing

For the train-test split, we use the original train-test split of the dataset, as provided. (The test split is much, much larger than the train split.)

We don't do any further preprocessing of the data.
