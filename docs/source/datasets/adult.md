# Adult Census Income Dataset

This particular adult census income dataset is a mix of mostly categorical attributes with a few continuous ones. The goal is to predict which side of the $50,000 threshold an adult is making.

You can read more of the description of the dataset from its [UCI ML Repo page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).
