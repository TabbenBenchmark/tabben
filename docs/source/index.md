## Getting Started

To install the package, you can use your favorite python package manager (we recommend Python 3.8). Using `pip` for example,
```shell
pip install tabben
```

Then you're off to the races! Check out [how to use the package](./python/tutorials/index.md), [walk-throughs with different machine learning frameworks](./python/integrations/index.md), or [details about the datasets](./datasets/index.md).

```{admonition} Interoperability with other packages
:class: note

Depending on what you want to use `tabben` with, you may need to install other packages to interoperate, e.g. `scikit-learn`, PyTorch, `autogluon`.
