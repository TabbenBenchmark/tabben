Our `kdd09` dataset is the full set of datasets used for the 2009 KDD Cup

You can read more of the description of the dataset from its [KDD Cup archive page](https://kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-2009/Intro).

## Data Preprocessing

For the train-test split, we use the original train-test split of the dataset (the last 500,000 examples form the test set).

We don't do any further preprocessing of the data.
