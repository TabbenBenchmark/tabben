# Documentation for the Benchmark

Most of the documentation can be found in either a Markdown format (used for generating the static web pages) or as a Jupyter notebook (includes all code and can be run top-down).

Jupyter notebooks are in the [notebooks](notebooks) subdirectory, and Markdown files are in the [source](source) subdirectory.

## Modifying the documentation

First, make sure the dependencies are installed (recommended in a virtual environment).
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The contents of the notebooks and the corresponding Markdown files are synced using the `jupytext` package.
Then go ahead and start up the jupyter server, *from this directory*.
```shell
jupyter serverextension enable jupytext
jupyter notebook  # or lab
```

Then, when you navigate to one of the source Markdown files, Jupyter will open it as a Jupyter notebook (and sync changes to both the Markdown and corresponding actual Jupyter notebook).

Non-synced Markdown files that have no corresponding notebook (i.e. any file outside of the integrations folder) can be directly edited.

## Documentation style

The documentation roughly follows the [Divio system](https://documentation.divio.com/) for documentation:
- [usage](../docs/content/python/tutorials): basic usage tutorials, getting started, etc.
- [integrations](../docs/content/python/integrations): how-to guides for working with this package and certain other packages
- reference: API reference and other technical docs (autogenerated)
- datasets: describes each dataset in human terms, things to watch out for, how the splits were determined, etc. (may also be autogenerated?)

## Building the documentation locally

The deployed version is built on GitHub Actions and then deployed directly to GitHub Pages. To test locally, make sure you've installed the python requirements as above. Then, you can build a local copy of the docs by running
```shell
make html
```
from this docs directory.
