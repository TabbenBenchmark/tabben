# Documentation for the Python Package

Most of the documentation can be found in either a Markdown format (used for generating the static web pages) or as a Jupyter notebook (includes all code and can be run top-down). (Of course, while notebooks are provided for all documentation pages, sometimes it doesn't make sense to run the notebook top down.)

Jupyter notebooks are in the [notebooks](notebooks) subdirectory, and Markdown files are in the [src](src) subdirectory.

## Modifying the documentation

The contents of the notebooks and the Markdown are synced using the `jupytext` package. First, make sure the dependencies are installed (recommended in a virtual environment).
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then go ahead and start up the jupyter server, *from this directory*.
```shell
jupyter serverextension enable jupytext
jupyter notebook  # or lab
```

Then, when you navigate to one of the source Markdown files, Jupyter will open it as a Jupyter notebook (and sync changes to both the Markdown and corresponding actual Jupyter notebook).

## Documentation style

The documentation roughly follows the [Divio system](https://documentation.divio.com/) for documentation:
- [usage](src/usage): basic usage tutorials, getting started, etc.
- [integrations](src/integrations): how-to guides for working with this package and certain other packages
- reference: API reference and other technical docs (autogenerated)
- datasets: describes each dataset in human terms, things to watch out for, how the splits were determined, etc. (may also be autogenerated?)
