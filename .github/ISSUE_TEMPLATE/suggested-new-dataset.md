## Data Details
**Describe your dataset in large terms (where did it come from, what's the domain, etc.).**
For example, where did it come from, how was it collected, what domain is it from, etc. Doesn't need to be long. (Include links if you have them.)

**Describe why you think this dataset should be included in the general benchmark**
We want to balance breadth of datasets with not adding too many datasets making it more difficult to run the whole benchmark.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or data descriptors about the dataset here. E.g. class imbalance, missing data, time series/seasonal component, extremely large (may need to be hosted off-GitHub).

## Attributes of the Data
**Task**: Classification, regression, etc.

**Number of outputs**: 

**Number of classes (only for classification)**: 

**Number of Examples**: Include sizes of train/valid/test splits if you have them

**Number and type (categorical vs. continuous) of attributes**:
